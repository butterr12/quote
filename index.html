        <p class="big-text">No one can make you feel inferior without your consent</p>
        <p>â€“ unless the burden of oppression weighs you down</p>
        <br>
        <p>We're supposed to believe, it's all in our hands,</p>
        <p>That feeling inferior is just our own plans.</p>
        <p>Yet how can we consent, in a world so unjust?</p>
        <p>Where inequality reigns, and misogyny's thrust.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So let's rewrite the narrative, let's tear down the walls,</p>
        <p>And refuse to accept society's calls.</p>
        <p>No more blaming the victim, it's time to confront,</p>
        <p>The systemic oppression that we all must front.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For "no one can make you feel inferior without your consent,"</p>
        <p>Is a lie we refuse, a truth we resent.</p>
        <p>It's time to reclaim our power, our voices, our pride,</p>
        <p>And stand tall in the face of the storm, side by side.</p>
